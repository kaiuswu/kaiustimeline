  <h1>10th</h1>
  <p>Kaius is admitted to a cram school that shoves a hoard of children into a small room where the
    desks and seats are touching each other. The teacher, an old smoker, teaches them curriculum grades ahead,
    giving them 80 pages of homework every week, and saying the names of those with the lowest grades for the tests.
    He was quick to berate and the kids werenâ€™t always friendly either. Later in middle school Kaius was sent to therapy
    at school because of their time there. </p>
